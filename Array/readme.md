# Array (Day-wise)

This folder is my day-wise learning log for **Arrays in Python**.

## Files

- [Array.py](Array.py)

## Day 1 — Arrays in Python (full `Array.py`)

What I learned / practiced in this file:

### 1) Python built-in `array` module (typecode arrays)

Explored (currently commented in code):

- Creating an `array('i', [...])`
- Iteration (by index + for-each)
- `typecode`, `reverse()`, `insert()`, `append()`
- Copying into a new array using a generator/comprehension
- `pop()`
- Slicing (including reverse slicing like `[::-1]`)
- Building an array from user input (“dynamic array” idea)

### 2) NumPy arrays (basics)

Explored / running now:

- Creating NumPy arrays
	- Scalar (0-D)
	- 1-D array
	- 2-D array (matrix)
	- 3-D array (tensor-like)
- Printing arrays to understand shapes/dimensions

Where in code:

- Python `array` examples are near the top of [Array.py](Array.py) (commented)
- NumPy examples are near the bottom of [Array.py](Array.py) (active)

Tip: Uncomment one block at a time so outputs stay clear.

## Setup

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` (needed for the Day 1 active code)

Install:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Run

From the repo root:

```bash
python "Array/Array.py"
```
