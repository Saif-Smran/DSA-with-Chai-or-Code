Learning Day 12: **Graph and Its Matrix Representation**
Learning Day 13: **Graph Adjacency List Representation**

## What I Have learned

- Graph basics (vertices/nodes and edges)
- Types of graphs: undirected, directed, weighted
- Graph representation using **Adjacency Matrix**
- Graph representation using **Adjacency List**

## Notes

- [Graph.md](Graph.md)

## Code

- [GraphAdjMatrix.py](GraphAdjMatrix.py) — basic adjacency-matrix graph class + example
- [AdjacencyList.py](AdjacencyList.py) — basic adjacency-list graph class + example

## Run

```bash
python "Graph/GraphAdjMatrix.py"
```

```bash
python "Graph/AdjacencyList.py"
```
